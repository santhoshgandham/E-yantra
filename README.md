# E-yantra
In the contingent of E-yantra, a 6-month-long competition conducted by IIT Bombay, I contributed to the development of a cyber-physical system. The system featured a robotic vehicle that established seamless communication between a Tensilica Xtensa LX6 processor (ESP32) and a Python code used for image detection by an overhead camera relying on OpenCV and PyTorch libraries. The system relied on Dijkstra's logic for short-path planning where the motion planning aspect involved coordinating IR sensors' readings and the L298N to drive the vehicle as it traversed a 10ftx10ft map which was live geo-referenced on QGIS with the use of ArUco markers printed on the map. The image detection process utilised a pre-trained model implemented in PyTorch. The architecture of the code involved complex interactions between the ESP32, Python, and the neural network model. The model, based on a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture, was trained using a pre-trained ResNet-34 model to recognise specific objects relevant to the taskâ€™s requirements.
